// gNMIDialOut defines a service which is used by a target system (typically a
// network element) to initiate connections to a client (collector). The server
// is implemented at the collector, such that the target can initiate connections
// to the collector, based on a configured set of telemetry subscriptions.

  // SubscribeResponse messaages, which have the same semantics as in the
  // gNMI Subscribe RPC, to a client. The client may optionally return the
  // PublishResponse message in response to the dial-out connection from the
  // target as acknowledgement to the SubscribeResponse message
  //
  // The configuration of subscriptions associated with the publish RPC may
  // be through the OpenConfig telemetry configuration and operational state
  // model:
  // https://github.com/openconfig/public/blob/master/release/models/telemetry/openconfig-telemetry.yang
